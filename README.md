# KINO | The Archive v1.0.0 🎬

> "I didn't use a framework because I don't need 'help.' I need control."

KINO is not just a movie tracker. It’s a high-performance, Glassmorphic vault for your cinematic history. Built with a "Directorial" mindset, it trades boring standard UI for a high-contrast, Noir-Crimson aesthetic that looks better than whatever you're currently using.

It runs on 10% coding knowledge, 90% Ben 10 re-runs, and a healthy amount of bullying AI until the pixels submitted.

## ⚡ Features (The High-Resolution Ego)

* **The 4K Monolith:** Generate ultra-high-res (2160x3840) share cards for any movie or show. If you're going to brag about your taste, do it in 4K.
* **Railgun Search:** A custom-weighted search engine that snaps open and filters through the TMDB database with zero friction.
* **Ghost Mode:** The UI is smart enough to know when to get out of the way. Stop moving, and the interface fades into the shadows, leaving only the cinema.
* **The Identity Pass:** A 3D-tilting, physical-style ticket stub that tracks your "Archive Rank" from Novice to Master Cinephile.
* **Granular TV Tracking:** Don't just mark a show as "watched." Track every single episode, season by season, with custom progress indicators.
* **3D Tilt Interaction:** Posters and UI elements react to your presence. It’s tactile. It’s moody. It’s Kino.

## 🚧 The "Director's Cut" (Known Issues)

Listen, every masterpiece has its quirks. 

1.  **Mobile is Forbidden:** Currently, KINO is meant for the big screen. If you open this on a phone, it will look like a glitch in the matrix. Mobile support is "broken" by design (or lack of patience).
2.  **Display Scaling:** Best viewed on 1080p and 4K displays. If your resolution is weird, the UI might judge you.
3.  **Bugs:** Unknown. If it breaks, it’s not a bug—it’s just the app entering "Recalibration Mode."
