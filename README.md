# KINO | The Archive v1.5.1 🎬

> "I didn't use a framework because I don't need 'help.' I need control."

**KINO** is not just a movie tracker. It’s a high-performance, Glassmorphic vault for your cinematic history. Built with a "Directorial" mindset, it trades boring standard UI for a high-contrast, Noir-Crimson aesthetic that looks better than whatever you're currently using.

It runs on **10% coding knowledge**, **90% Ben 10 re-runs**, and a healthy amount of **bullying AI** until the pixels surrendered.

## 📱 v1.5.1: The "Obsidian Protocol" Update

In v1.0, I explicitly stated that *KINO* was for the big screen. But then I looked at my phone, saw a broken UI, and my ego couldn't handle it. So, after another 48-hour marathon of *Ben 10: Alien Force* and aggressively bullying Gemini into understanding touch events, I am releasing **The Obsidian Protocol**.

The Archive now fits in your pocket. And honestly? It might look better there than on your desktop.

## ⚡ Features (The High-Resolution Ego)

### **The Obsidian Protocol (Mobile OS)**

We didn't just "patch" mobile support. We built a completely separate, touch-native OS for your phone.

* **The Morphing Glass Dock:** A dynamic navigation hub that sits at the bottom of your screen. It expands, contracts, and reacts to your touch with physics-based animations.
* **Railgun Mobile:** Double-tap the Home button to instantly trigger the search bar. It snaps open, blurs the world, and finds your movie before you finish typing.
* **Gyro-Parallax:** The "Hero" posters on mobile react to how you hold your phone using the gyroscope. It’s tactile. It’s moody. It’s Kino.

### **The Installable Monolith (PWA)**

* **Native App Experience:** KINO is now a fully functional Progressive Web App.
* **Add to Home Screen:** Install it on iOS or Android. No URL bar. No browser UI. Just pure cinema in full screen.
* **Offline-Ready:** Thanks to a custom Service Worker, the UI loads instantly, even if your internet is acting up.

### **The 4K Monolith**

* **Ultra-Res Share Cards:** Generate 2160x3840 posters to flex your taste on social media. If you're going to be a snob about cinema, do it in 4K.

### **Director Mode**

* **Total Blackout:** Reading the credits or the "Director's Note"? The UI fades away, the dock vanishes, and the lights go out. It’s just you and the text.

### **The Identity Pass**

* **3D Ticket Stub:** A physical-style ticket that tracks your "Archive Rank" from Novice to Master Cinephile. On desktop, it tilts in 3D based on your mouse cursor.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (The Pure Stuff)

* **Styling:** Raw CSS3 (Custom Beziers, Backdrop Blurs, Masking)
* **Markup:** Semantic HTML5
* **Engine:** The Movie Database (TMDB) API
* **Rendering:** html2canvas (Modified for 4K output)
* **PWA:** Service Workers & Web Manifest

## 🔮 The Roadmap (Coming Soon)

We aren't done. The sequel is already in pre-production.

1. **The Cloud Upgrade:** Currently, KINO lives in `LocalStorage` (fragile). I am working on a real database so your watchlist survives the apocalypse (or a cache clear).
2. **Universal Scaling:** Teaching the UI to stop judging people with weird monitor resolutions.
3. **Optimization:** Aiming for 60fps butter-smooth animations, even on potato phones.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Battery Life:** The glassmorphism is heavy. It looks cool, but your battery might hate me.
2. **Addiction:** You might spend more time organizing your watchlist than actually watching movies.
3. **Bugs:** If it breaks, it’s not a bug—it’s just the app entering **"Recalibration Mode."**

## 🖋 Credits

**Lead Architect:** PreritK.
**Fuel Source:** 50+ re-watches of Ben 10 and pure spite.
**Consultant:** A heavily bullied (but loved) Gemini AI.

*It’s Hero Time.* Muaa.
