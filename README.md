# KINO | The Archive v1.5.2 🎬

> "Performance is not a feature. It is the Director's cut."

**KINO** is a high-performance, glassmorphic vault for your cinematic history. Built with a "Directorial" mindset, it trades boring standard UI for a high-contrast, Noir-Crimson aesthetic that looks better than whatever you're currently using.

It runs on **Vanilla JS**, **pure spite**, and **bullying AI** until the code runs at 60fps.

## 🔋 v1.5.2: The "Recalibration" Update

In v1.5.1, I gave you beauty. In v1.5.2, I give you **speed**.

I looked at the battery drain on my phone and realized my "art" was killing your device. Unacceptable. So, I entered **Recalibration Mode**. I stripped the engine down, threw out the heavy math, and rebuilt the core to run cooler, faster, and smoother.

Your phone will no longer melt. You're welcome.

## ⚡ Patch Notes (The Optimization Arc)

### **1. The Battery Saver Protocol**

We stopped treating your phone like a supercomputer.

* **Lazy Loading:** Images now only load when you scroll to them. The days of downloading 50 posters at once are over.
* **4K Deprecation:** The Hero section now uses high-bitrate 1080p instead of raw 4K. You won't see the difference, but your RAM will.
* **Gyroscope Deleted:** I removed the "tilt" effect on mobile. It was cool, but it was eating your CPU alive. Gone.

### **2. Cinematic Transitions (No More Sliding)**

Standard "slide left/right" animations are for boring apps.

* **Depth & Blur:** Navigation now uses a "Cinema" depth effect. Old pages fade and shrink into the background; new pages zoom in from a blur. It feels expensive. It feels native.

### **3. Smart Railgun Search**

* **New Logic:** The search engine now intelligently mixes **Movies** and **People**. It finds exact title matches *and* director filmographies, then sorts them by popularity.

### **4. Ghost Mode (Mobile Only)**

* **Auto-Hide UI:** Stop touching the screen for 3 seconds, and the Dock and Search button vanish. Pure immersion.
* **Notch Support:** The header now respects your iPhone's notch. No more content hiding behind the battery icon.

### **5. The 4K Share Card**

* **Fixed:** No more "Gray Box" glitches when sharing.
* **Upgraded:** Share links now generate a direct Google Search link for the movie.

* **PWA:** Service Workers (Offline Capable)

## 🔮 The Roadmap

1. **The Cloud Upgrade:** `LocalStorage` is still fragile. A real database is the next major arc.
2. **Universal Scaling:** Teaching the UI to stop judging people with weird monitor resolutions.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Addiction:** The new animations are so smooth you might just open and close menus for fun.
2. **Bugs:** If it breaks, it’s not a bug—it’s just a plot twist.
