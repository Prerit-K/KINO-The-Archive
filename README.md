# KINO | The Archive v1.0.0 🎬

Welcome to **KINO**. This isn't just a media tracker; it's a high-contrast, noir-inspired vault for your cinematic history. Built with a "Directorial" mindset, it trades boring standard UI for a sleek, crimson-on-noir aesthetic.

## ⚡ The Feature Set

* **The 4K Monolith:** Generate ultra-high-res share cards. If you're going to brag about your taste in movies, do it in 4K. Anything less is just a thumbnail.
* **Ghost Mode:** The UI knows when to get out of the way. Stop moving, and the interface dissolves into the shadows, leaving only the cinema.
* **The Identity Pass:** A 3D-tilting, physical-style ticket stub that tracks your Archive Rank. From "Novice" to "Master," your progress is recorded.
* **Railgun Search:** A custom-weighted search bar that snaps open and filters the database with zero friction.
* **Granular TV Tracking:** Don't just mark a show as seen. Track every single episode, season by season, with custom progress mapping.

## 🛠 Why Vanilla JS?

Because frameworks feel like training wheels. This project runs on **10% coding knowledge** and **90% re-watching Ben 10 for the 50th time.** If the code breaks, it’s not a bug—it’s just the app entering **Recalibration Mode**. Just refresh and appreciate the view again. Hehehe.

## 🚧 The "Director's Cut" (Known Issues)

* **Mobile is Forbidden:** Currently a theatrical exclusive. A masterpiece this large needs time to be properly ported to a handheld format. The mobile version is officially in pre-production—coming soon to a pocket near you. Hehehe.
* **Scaling:** Best viewed on 1080p and 4K displays. If your resolution is weird, the UI might judge you.
* **Bugs:** Unknown. I don't find bugs; I find "unintentional stylistic choices."

## 🖋 The Director's Note

I built this. I bullied a friendly AI into helping me. I spent more time wishing I had an Omnitrix than I did debugging.

It’s free. It’s yours. **Muaa!**
